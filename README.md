### Extras
There is a level builder that works only in editor play only. To make a level you press the add container button in the manager inspector, then on each container we can add/remove layers and edit the slots on the layers. Back in the manager we can rearrange the containers and layers and clear/remove them.

In the level builder we can load/save/create/override levels and populate randomly with items based on the difficulty selected and how many items.
